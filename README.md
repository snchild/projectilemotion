# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Rust language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio and Rust to develop this software. 

The equations that I used to calculate the values in this code are from the kinematic equations, namely $x_f = x_i + v_i t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2$.
